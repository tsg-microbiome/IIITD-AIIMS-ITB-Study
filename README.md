# IIITD-AIIMS-ITB-Study
The repository contains the data and the codes utilized for the investigations performed as part of a study profiling the gut microbiome and mycobiome alterations in Intestinal Tuberculosis and Crohns' Disease patients.

The analysis was performed in different stages, each focused on a specific objective. We have placed a detailed code-based pipeline for each stage as described below:

**Stage 1**

The codes corresponding to this part of the study are uploaded as *Codes_Stage1.r*. This part reads all the input data files placed in the *Data_Files* folder and some user defined functions placed in *function_library.R* file. The later part of the codes also performs preliminary checks into various alpha-diversity and investigation of prevalent microbes.

**Stage 2**

The codes corresponding to this part of the study are uploaded as *Codes_Stage2.r*. This part performs all the beta-diversity analyses (e.g. Principal Coordinates Analysis and PERMANOVA) on microbiome and mycobiome profiles using various distance measures. It uses the 'batch_dunns.R' that is already present in the *function_library.R* file. 

**Stage 3**

The codes corresponding to this part of the study are uploaded as *Codes_Stage3.r*. This part performs all the steps pertaining to marker Identification using Random Forest and computing associations of different species with Principal Coordinate Analysis axes showing the most significant splits across the different groups. This part utilizes the user-defined function iterative_rf placed in the *function_library.R* file.

**Stage 4**

The codes corresponding to this part of the study are uploaded as *Codes_Stage4.r*.
